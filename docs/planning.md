* started to look at AWS code pipeline: need to understand how this is done so i can have few apps and test in parallel the code

# potential apps

* fast-shell - application container
* shell-apps - application repository
* shell-users - application that will manage the users : roles permissions



 # Notes
 
 * focus on the application framework only, don't think of how the app is deployed and delivered
